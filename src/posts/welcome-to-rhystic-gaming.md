Welcome to **Rhystic Gaming**—my personal journal for documenting my journey back into competitive Magic: The Gathering.

## A Long Hiatus

I've been playing Magic since 1993. Back in the day, I played pretty competitively up until around 1998-1999, then life happened and competitive play fell by the wayside. Now, after all these years, I'm getting back into it.

A lot of my friends are rediscovering Magic too. Most are playing casually, but some are diving into competitive play, and that's given me the opportunity to revisit something I used to love. I want to see how well I can still do at this game after all this time.

## What This Is (And Isn't)

This blog is primarily **for me**. It's a place to chronicle my experiences, document what I'm learning, and keep track of the ups and downs as I navigate competitive tournament Magic again. I'll be writing about:

- **Tournament Reports**: What happened, what went right, what went wrong
- **Deck Building & Testing**: What I'm playing, why, and how it's working
- **Meta Observations**: What I'm seeing in the formats I play
- **Lessons Learned**: Mistakes, breakthroughs, and things I'm figuring out
- **The Journey**: The highs, the lows, and everything in between

This isn't really meant to be a resource for other players—though if someone finds value in it, that's great. Mostly, it's my way of keeping track of my own progress and experiences as I work my way back into competitive play.

## About the Name

The name "Rhystic Gaming" comes from **Rhystic Study**, one of those cards that's become iconic in the community. "Did you pay the {1}?" has become a meme, but it's also a reminder to pay attention to the details—something that matters a lot in competitive Magic.

So here we go. Time to see if I still have it, and document the journey along the way.
