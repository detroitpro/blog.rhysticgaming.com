**Event:** MBG Monthly  
**Team:** TBD  
**Player:** EP  
**Deck:** [Kefka, Court Mage // Kefka, Ruler of Ruin](https://scryfall.com/card/fin/231/kefka-court-mage-kefka-ruler-of-ruin)

## Friday

Stopped by Upkeep to pick up sleeves and a [Vexing Bauble](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/vexing-bauble).

This was the first cEDH event where I had a decklist, sleeved deck, and registration completed the night before — which made the next day much smoother.

---

## Event Day

The event starting at noon and being close was great. I arrived about 45 minutes early. Garmo was still waiting on breakfast from *The Crunchy Pickle*, so I went in, paid at the counter, and checked in with the head judge.

## Round 1  
**Seat 1:** [Etali, Primal Conqueror](https://scryfall.com/card/mom/137/etali-primal-conqueror)  
**Seat 2:** [Atraxa, Grand Unifier](https://scryfall.com/card/one/196/atraxa-grand-unifier)  
**Seat 3:** [Rograkh, Son of Rogahh](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/204/rograkh-son-of-rogahh) / [Silas Renn, Seeker Adept](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/48/silas-renn-seeker-adept)  
**Seat 4:** Me — [Kefka](https://scryfall.com/card/fin/231/kefka-court-mage-kefka-ruler-of-ruin)

### Turn 1
None of us should have seen a turn. [Etali, Primal Conqueror](https://scryfall.com/card/mom/137/etali-primal-conqueror) went off on 1, but the pilot made a few mistakes that likely cost him the game. Etali is a hard deck to play well because you’re essentially building a deck out of everyone else’s cards.  

After Etali passed, [Atraxa, Grand Unifier](https://scryfall.com/card/one/196/atraxa-grand-unifier) set up; [Rograkh, Son of Rogahh](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/204/rograkh-son-of-rogahh) / [Silas Renn, Seeker Adept](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/48/silas-renn-seeker-adept) dashed [Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/138/ragavan-nimble-pilferer); I played a few rocks and, if we got another turn, was ready for turn 2 [Kefka](https://scryfall.com/card/fin/231/kefka-court-mage-kefka-ruler-of-ruin).

### Turn 2
Etali’s turn 2 was met with interaction from everyone. He fizzled at 1 life and, out of frustration, cracked a fetchland and scooped.  

Atraxa continued setup; Rog/Si dashed Rag again; I played Kefka. After the fight with Etali, none of us were ready to go off.

### Turn 3
Atraxa cast Atraxa, saw 10 cards, took one to flicker her, effectively seeing 10 more. They grabbed a [Mindbreak Trap](https://scryfall.com/card/zen/67/mindbreak-trap) and some ramp.  

Rog/Si was light on resources but tried to put a win on the stack. I had priority but knew Atraxa had MBT. When asked if I could respond, I said “I have limited interaction, not really — I pass.” That forced Atraxa to use MBT. Once they did, I responded with [Fierce Guardianship](https://scryfall.com/card/c20/42/fierce-guardianship).  

We talked it through — I could flip Kefka, draw 5, and still have 10 mana open. But since it was Round 1 and we all “should have had a loss” from Etali’s near-win, I offered a draw, and we took it.

## Round 2  
**Seat 1:** [Blue Farm — Kraum, Ludevic’s Opus](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/47/kraum-ludevics-opus) / [Tymna the Weaver](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/49/timna-the-weaver)  
**Seat 2:** [Tivit, Seller of Secrets](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/222/tivit-seller-of-secrets)  
**Seat 3:** Me — [Kefka](https://scryfall.com/card/fin/231/kefka-court-mage-kefka-ruler-of-ruin)  
**Seat 4:** [Tivit, Seller of Secrets](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/222/tivit-seller-of-secrets)

My first time playing against [Tivit, Seller of Secrets](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/222/tivit-seller-of-secrets). The table was friendly and explained how the deck wins. Blue Farm mulled to 5 and stayed land-locked all game.

### Turn 1
Seat 3 played [Mystic Remora](https://scryfall.com/card/ice/79/mystic-remora) (“Fish”). The table debated feeding the Fish.  

On my turn: land → [Sol Ring](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/308/sol-ring) → [Signet](https://scryfall.com/search?q=type%3Aartifact+signet) → used the mana to kill the Fish. Set up for turn 2 Kefka, no Fish in play, Tivit slow, Blue Farm behind.

### Turn 2
Everyone set up; I played Kefka. After the trigger I had [Vampiric Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/vis/57/vampiric-tutor) and [Imperial Seal](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/95/imperial-seal) in hand — could Vamp for [Thassa’s Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle), Seal for [Demonic Consultation](https://scryfall.com/card/ice/106/demonic-consultation) — but Seat 4 cast [Swords to Plowshares](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/32/swords-to-plowshares) on Kefka, ruining that line.

### Turn 3
Blue Farm: played [Tymna the Weaver](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/49/timna-the-weaver)  
Seat 4/Tivit: played [Rhystic Study](https://scryfall.com/card/cns/52/rhystic-study)  

I misplayed and drew before using [Vampiric Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/vis/57/vampiric-tutor) in upkeep, forcing a pivot. I bounced Rhystic with [Cyclonic Rift](https://scryfall.com/card/rtr/35/cyclonic-rift), then played [Orcish Bowmasters](https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/102/orcish-bowmasters) and passed with counters up.  

Seat 4 played [The One Ring](https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/246/the-one-ring). We became friends: he drew, I pinged.  

Later, a [Mockingbird](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/89/mockingbird) copied my OBM, killed it, and I used [Volatile Stormdrake](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/93/volatile-stormdrake) to steal his Mockingbird back — regaining OBM, swinging with an 18/18 Orc army, flipping Kefka, attacking, and drawing 18 cards.

## Round 3  
**Seat 1:** Me — [Kefka](https://scryfall.com/card/fin/231/kefka-court-mage-kefka-ruler-of-ruin)  
**Seat 2:** [Ral, Monsoon Mage // Ral, Leyline Prodigy](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/247/ral-monsoon-mage-ral-leyline-prodigy)  
**Seat 3:** [Atraxa, Grand Unifier](https://scryfall.com/card/one/196/atraxa-grand-unifier)  
**Seat 4:** [Rograkh, Son of Rogahh](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/204/rograkh-son-of-rogahh) / [Silas Renn, Seeker Adept](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/48/silas-renn-seeker-adept)

Turn 1 [Vexing Bauble](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/vexing-bauble) into two fast decks — correct choice.  
Turn 3, after a [Rhystic Study](https://scryfall.com/card/cns/52/rhystic-study), I tapped out for Kefka. I learned I need to keep agency over Bauble: only tap out if I have [Simian Spirit Guide](https://scryfall.com/card/plist/404/simian-spirit-guide) in hand; otherwise keep mana to crack it.

## Round 4  
**Seat 1:** Me — [Kefka](https://scryfall.com/card/fin/231/kefka-court-mage-kefka-ruler-of-ruin)  
**Seat 2:** [Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/192/kinnan-bonder-prodigy)  
**Seat 3:** [Blue Farm — Kraum, Ludevic’s Opus](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/47/kraum-ludevics-opus) / [Tymna the Weaver](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/49/timna-the-weaver)  
**Seat 4:** [Terra Stomper](https://scryfall.com/card/znr/198/terra-stomper) (?)

### Turn 1
Me: land → Sol Ring → [Lion’s Eye Diamond](https://scryfall.com/card/mir/305/lions-eye-diamond).  
[Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/192/kinnan-bonder-prodigy): Kinnan + rock.  
Blue Farm: setup.  

### Turn 2
I played The One Ring, drew [Mindbreak Trap](https://scryfall.com/card/zen/67/mindbreak-trap).  
Kinnan set up further with [Reshape](https://scryfall.com/card/5dn/35/reshape) fetching another Sol Ring.  

Blue Farm went off with [Ad Nauseam](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/85/ad-nauseam) to 5 life. Terra countered [Silence](https://scryfall.com/card/10e/36/silence) with [Flare of Duplication](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/126/flare-of-duplication). Blue Farm cast [An Offer You Can’t Refuse](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/49/an-offer-you-cant-refuse), but Kinnan had [Pact of Negation](https://scryfall.com/card/fut/47/pact-of-negation) and mana to pay later.  

Terra took their turn, then Blue Farm cast [Final Fortune](https://scryfall.com/card/5ed/167/final-fortune) to take another. They played out, cast [Thassa’s Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle), and put [Demonic Consultation](https://scryfall.com/card/ice/106/demonic-consultation) on the stack. I fired MBT — they conceded.  

Kinnan had 1 card, Terra 2, me 3 plus The One Ring. I cast Kefka, drew from Ring + Kefka, then used [Underworld Breach](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach), [Demonic Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/87/demonic-tutor), LED, and finally [Brain Freeze](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/37/brain-freeze) for the win.

---

## Round 5  
Seat order unclear. Seat 3 (Rocco) was the only player who couldn’t draw into Top Cut. We agreed that if any of the three of us won, we’d concede to Rocco and draw.  
[Ral, Monsoon Mage // Ral, Leyline Prodigy](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/247/ral-monsoon-mage-ral-leyline-prodigy) did Ral things and won.

---

## Semifinals  
**Seat 1:** [Rograkh, Son of Rogahh](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/204/rograkh-son-of-rogahh) / [Silas Renn, Seeker Adept](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/48/silas-renn-seeker-adept)  
**Seat 2:** Me — [Kefka](https://scryfall.com/card/fin/231/kefka-court-mage-kefka-ruler-of-ruin)  
**Seat 3:** [Tymna the Weaver](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/49/timna-the-weaver) / [Kraum, Ludevic’s Opus](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/47/kraum-ludevics-opus) (TnK)  
**Seat 4:** Stella Lee

## Reflections

### What Went Well
- Turn-2 Kefka is a solid plan.  
- Reaching turn 4 often led to wins.  
- Strong mulligan decisions overall.  
- Thoughtful assessment of each player’s table role.  
- Seat order meaningfully affected keep decisions.

### What Didn’t
- A few play mistakes (fewer each tournament).  
- Forgot to [Vampiric Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/vis/57/vampiric-tutor) during upkeep.  
- Used [Demonic Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/87/demonic-tutor) without a plan when *Thassa’s Oracle* was exiled.  
- [Pact of Negation](https://scryfall.com/card/fut/47/pact-of-negation) in the graveyard under [Underworld Breach](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach) is a blank — no need to load up Pyroblast mana when Pact covers it.

### Lessons Learned
- [Deflecting Swat](https://scryfall.com/card/c20/28/deflecting-swat) can target a spell to itself; when Swat resolves first, the spell fizzles.  
- [The Cabbage Merchant](https://scryfall.com/card/tle/134/the-cabbage-merchant) is going to be interesting.
