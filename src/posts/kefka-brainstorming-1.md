## Getting Started

I don't feel like this deck, or at least my play style is focused on winning "on top" of other players. Considering we are mostly a "tap out" deck on the first few turns and I'd rather focus on creating eventuallatiy.

For example, when I play [[Kefka, Court Mage // Kefka, Ruler of Ruin]], I'm looking to build value over time rather than going for immediate wins. Cards like [[Rhystic Study]] and [[Mystic Remora]] help me draw into my win conditions.
